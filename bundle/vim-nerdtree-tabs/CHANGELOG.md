# vim-nerdtree-tabs changelog

## v1.0.0

* NERDTree view synchronization (cursor position and scroll) across tabs
* Fix: focus is now on NERDTree when opening it in all tabs.
* If you create more NERDTree instances, nerdtree-tabs now tries hard to sync
  all tabs to the last opened one.

## v0.2.0

* Better solution for opening NERDTree on tab creation (fixes wrong behavior in
  improbable situations)
* Global variables for configuration
* Tab autoclose
* Option to open NERDTree on console vim startup, stays false by default
* Readme


## v0.1.0

* New mappings and a command, otherwise original functionality preserved while making it namespaced
